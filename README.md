# blend.js
The HTML5 image manipulation tool.


## Description
blend.js is a simple JS library used to partition images and let you apply effects on them. It uses a data structure (2D grid) to represent a map on which images are projected. You can then easily apply effects on image areas while the library handles partioning and looping for you.


## How does it work?
Firstly, create a grid for the image we want to blend:
```javascript
// Using jQuery to get an image, for example
var img = $('img')[0];
var blender = blend.blend(img, 2, 2);
```

Secondly, create an effect, which is a custom function that receives either a canvas context, either some pixels data.
In order to abstract this difference, we use one of the 2 factory functions provided:
```javascript
var contextfx = blend.cfx(function(context) {
	// Check HTML5 ImageData documentation to know more.
	return context;
});
var pixelfx = blend.pfx(function(pixels) {
	// Check HTML5 CanvasRenderingContext2D documentation to know more.
	return pixels;
});
```

Now, we're ready to modify the image, zone by zone:
```javascript
// apply the effects on each part (so it's called 4 times with a different context each time):
blender.fx(pixelfx).fx(contextfx);
// update the image
blender.update();
```

For more flexibility, we can pass any custom params:
```javascript
// create some effects that will use additional params
var colorfx = blend.cfx(function(color, context) { return context; });
var anglefx = blend.pfx(function(angle, radius, pixels) { return pixels; });

// one param means it is passed for every zone
blender.fx(colorfx, 'rgb(255, 123, 123)').fx(anglefx, [Math.PI, .25]);

// more than one param means each zone gets its own param
blender.fx(colorfx, '#FFF', '#AAA', '#666', '#111');

// null is used to skip zones
blender.fx(colorfx, '#FFF', null, null, '#111');

// update the image
blender.update();
```

If you're attentive, you see that custom params come first. So if you like to bind params before hand, you can:
```javascript
// bind a value to the first function param
var pianglefx = anglefx.bind(Math.PI);
// apply the fx with only the second param
blender.fx(pianglefx, .25);
// update the image
blender.update();
```


## Where are the effects?
The library provides some basic effects, under the `fx` namespace. You can refer to the `index.html` and the demo to see some of them.


## Any test?
Sure, for the main part (the blender and the grid). The effects are not tested yet.
